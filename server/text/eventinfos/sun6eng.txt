Join us for an evening of icy sonic wonder - an eclectic visual and auditive program dedicated to environmental awareness in a fast changing modern world. The program will feature top female Finnish flutists Annaleena Jämsä, Malla Vivolin, Jenny Villanen, and Johanna Kärkkäinen, pianist Hanna-Leena Savolainen, kantelist Eva Akula, and exciting works by composers Cecilia Damström, Kai Nieminen, Jouni Kaipainen, Väinö Hannikainen and many more. 
JÄÄ//ICE combines the world of classical music, with the experimental. A contrasting and connecting world of sounds and visions, the audience will experience a multitude of textures created by Dutch composer and artist Samuel Van Dijk, AND YOU, our audience. As part of TFF’s exciting collaboration with the Tampere University, and with thanks to software developers Eva Wallinvirta, Henri Turunen, Roshan Bist, Samuel Gonçalves, Eliana Junker, Joona Mäkinen, and Samu Salko from the university, our audience will be able to interact and be part of the creation process, moulding the sound and visual textures, that will be ultimately presented at the gala concert. This will take place some days before. More information will be released shortly before the festival on the TFF website: www.tampereflutefest.com 
This concert will raise funds in support of young Ukrainian artists affected by the war. Winners of the 2022 Young Artist Competition Category A will be announced in a short ceremony taking place at the start of the Gala Concert.
